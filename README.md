# Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM)

This is an implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) written in Python. This code allows for the calculation of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional free energy profiles using data sampled from umbrella simulations. For more information, [read the attached PDF](WHAM_Equations__1D_and_2D.pdf) summarizing the equations used in WHAM-1D and WHAM-2D.
